# stylish-blocking-and-clean-up

Cleans up various websites. Removes stuff like clickjacking etc.

Intended to be used with [dizzyzane.web.fc2.com/SpeedeeArticles/DizzyZane/Blocking/](http://dizzyzane.web.fc2.com/SpeedeeArticles/DizzyZane/Blocking/).

Requires stylish. View [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) for some instructions on getting it.

The files are preprocessed using LESS, so things like a preferred colour and background colour are (and will later be) available.

You are free to use and/or clone. Attribution, whilst not required, is useful.

View main.css for a more importable, editable and readable version and main.min.css for a more compact version, especially if you're going to be importing the file where you're not going to see it.

I plan on making it automatically update sometime soon.

Thank you for your time.
